Pre-requisite:
1. Node.js and NPM should be installed on Windows
2. Visual Studio Code IDE should be installed from - "https://code.visualstudio.com/download" for Windows.

Steps to Run the test :-

1. Run "npm install cypress" command in Visual Studio Code terminal.
2. Now Run "npx cypress open" command (Cypress modal with spec.js files name should open)
3. Place the Trayio.spec.js file in Explorer>Cypress(Folder)>Integration>examples and save
4. Trayio.spec.js should apear in the modal opened earlier, click this file to runn the test


Cypress test files can be easily extended to add and run more test. It defines a standard framework which can be extended with minimum changes in the folder structure. It would capture your screenshots on failure automatically.
